Comparing Redux & Context API

Context API	
> Built-in tool that ships with React	
> Requires minimal Setup	
> Specifically designed for static data, that is not often refreshed or updated	
> Adding new contexts requires creation from scratch	
> Debugging can be hard in highly nested React Component Structure even with Dev Tool	
> UI logic and State Management Logic are in the same component	


Redux
> Additional installation Required, driving up the final bundle size
> Requires extensive setup to integrate it with a React Application
> Works like a charm with both static and dynamic data
> Easily extendible due to the ease of adding new data/actions after the initial setup
> Incredibly powerful Redux Dev Tools to ease debugging
> Better code organization with separate UI logic and State Management Logic
